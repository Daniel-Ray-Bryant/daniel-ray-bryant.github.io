Daniel Bryant | Kloud Pixel Studios Portfolio
This repository hosts the official portfolio website for Daniel Bryant, founder of Kloud Pixel Studios. The site is a showcase of my skills in game development, web and app coding, and graphic design, built to provide a polished and immersive user experience.

The website uses a dynamic single-page application model. Navigation links show and hide different sections of the page, eliminating the need for separate HTML files.

Sections
The website is divided into the following key sections:

Home
The main landing page features a hero section with a professional headshot, name, and a brief biography. When visible, it also includes the "Showcasing my digital expertise" section.

About
The "About" page provides a more detailed biography and personal statement, along with a headshot, offering insight into my background and passion for development.

Projects
This section acts as a central hub, linking to four detailed project pages. Each of these pages is dedicated to a specific area of my expertise:

Unreal Engine Projects: Showcasing game builds using Unreal Engine.

C++ Projects: A collection of projects focused on crafting unique game mechanics and systems.

Web & Mobile Games: A gallery of interactive browser games created with web technologies.

Graphic Design: A showcase of my visual design work, including UI/UX mock-ups and promotional graphics.

Contact
This page contains a functional form for professional inquiries, job opportunities, or collaborations. It also includes my phone number, location, and email for easy access. The "Let's build your next project together" banner is visible on every page, providing a consistent call-to-action.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure of the website.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling, ensuring a fully responsive and mobile-first design.

JavaScript: For all interactivity, including the dynamic page navigation and the card animations on the Projects hub.
